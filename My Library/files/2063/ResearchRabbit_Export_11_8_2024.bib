Several terms are employed almost interchangeably across various application domains to refer to the multi-scale concept - e.g., hierarchy, holarchy, multi-level, multi-layer, nested, embedded, micro-macro or coarse graining. While the concrete meanings behind these terms may differ slightly, several core commonalities persist across all cases. In this position paper we aim to highlight these common features of the multi-scale concept, as a preliminary basis for a generic theory of multi-scale systems. We discuss the concepts of scale and multi-scale systems in general, and then of multi-scale feedback systems in particular, focusing on the role played by information in such systems. Our long-term objective is to develop a general theory of multi-scale feedback systems, applicable across all domains dealing with complex systems.}}

Studies on the effects of timing on system properties are often domain specific. The Multi-Scale Abstraction Feedbacks (MSAF) design pattern aims to generalise the description and understanding of multi-scale systems where feedback occurs across scales. We expand on MSAF to include timing considerations. We then apply these considerations to two models: a hierarchical oscillator (HO) and a hierarchical cellular automata (HCA). Results show how (i) different timing configurations significantly affect system macro-properties and (ii) different regions of time configurations can lead to the same macro-properties. These results contribute to theory, while also providing useful insights for designing and controlling such systems.}}

We show that information about relevant parameters is preserved, with distances along relevant directions maintained under flow. By contrast, irrelevant parameters become less distinguishable under the flow, with distances along irrelevant directions contracting according to renormalization group exponents. We develop a covariant formalism to understand the contraction of the model manifold. We then apply our tools to understand the emergence of the diffusion equation and more general statistical systems described by a free energy. Our results give an information-theoretic justification of universality in terms of the flow of the model manifold under coarse-graining.}}

Here I propose that we can gain traction on downward causation by being operational and examining how adaptive systems identify regularities in evolutionary or learning time and use these regularities to guide behaviour. I suggest that in many adaptive systems components collectively compute their macroscopic worlds through coarse-graining. I further suggest we move from simple feedback to downward causation when components tune behaviour in response to estimates of collectively computed macroscopic properties. I introduce a weak and strong notion of downward causation and discuss the role the strong form plays in the origins of new organizational levels. I illustrate these points with examples from the study of biological and social systems and deep neural networks.  This article is part of the themed issue ‘Reconceptualizing the origins of life’.}}

I argue that in the constructive field theory tradition, RG techniques do illuminate the microscopic dynamics of a QFT, which are not automatically given by axiomatic QFT. RG techniques in constructive field theory are also rigorous, so one cannot object to their foundational import on grounds of lack of rigor.}}

Multi-scale coordination schemes are prevalent in large-scale systems with bounded performance requirements and limited resource constraints. However, theories to formalise how coordination can be implemented across multi-scale systems are often domain-specific, lacking generic, reusable principles. In these systems, feedback among system entities is a key component to coordination. Building on theories of hierarchies and complexity, in previous work we formalised Multi-Scale Abstraction Feedbacks (MSAF) as a design pattern to describe the architecture of feedback across system scales, highlighting the role played by micro-entities and macro-entities, as well as their interconnections. Focusing on exogenous coordination, this paper refines the MSAF pattern, describing a feedback cycle across scales as one where information flows bottom-up and top-down through five actions: state information communication, state information abstraction, information processing, control information communication, and adaptation from control information. Abstracted state information at each scale is processed with control input from the scale above and provides control input to the scale below. Using the example of distributed task allocation through exogenous coordination, NetLogo simulations are implemented to analyse the impact that different exogenous coordination strategies, and their internal timing configurations, have on resource consumption and on convergence performance. The experimental insights and refinement of the MSAF pattern contribute to a general theory of multi-scale feedback and adaptation. This architectural pattern and associated analysis and evaluation tools are still developing, but offer a concrete basis for further expansion, improvement, and implementation, while addressing questions that are at the core of the behaviour of multi-scale systems.}}
