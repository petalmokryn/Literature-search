This is the sum total of my literature search, organized via tags & folders, with full content attached as PDF/DJVU/etc for you to read.
To access the full structure of this library:
1. Download the full "My Library" folder from this github repository, and unzip the download.
2. Download Zotero for free from https://www.zotero.org/
3. Create a Zotero library in which you want to store my literature search.
4. In Zotero, click File->Import
5. Choose "A file (Bibtex, RIS, Zotero RDF, etc.)" and press "Next".
6. Navigate to the downloaded "My Library" folder, go into it, and click the "My Library.rdf" file.
7. Continue with Zotero's default option until the wizard finishes its work. Zotero will download the full library for you.

Enjoy!
